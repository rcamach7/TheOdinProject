            <h1>How To Become Wealthy</h1>
        </header>
        <main>
            <h2>It all starts in your mind. Wealth is created from within</h2>
            <p>It's important to realize that before any wealth is to come to your life, you must first <strong>BELIEVE</strong> and <strong>IMAGINE</strong> you are capable of being wealthy</p>
            <p>How do you create this belief within? Great question! <em>It's all in the study of the mind!</em></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Objective / Conscious Mind (what you see, hear, taste, and smell)</li>
                <li>Subconscious Mind (what you regularly think about is passed into here)</li>
                <li>Visualization (picture in your mind the completion of your goals, imagine them accomplished already) </li>
            </ul>
            <strong>Study these subjects and unlock unlimmited potential!</strong>
